## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within this project, we would greatly appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner. We are committed to addressing security vulnerabilities quickly and ensuring the safety of our users.

### How to Report

1. **Email:** Send an email to `m7amadaymankh@gmail.com` with the subject line: "Security Vulnerability in [SDP Project]".

2. **Provide Details**: Include as much information as possible to help us reproduce and understand the vulnerability. Ideally, this includes:
   - A detailed description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
   - Any potential impact on the system or its users.
   - Suggestions for remediation, if any.

3. **Confidentiality**: Please keep the details of any potential vulnerabilities confidential until we can address them. We will work with you to ensure that any disclosures are handled responsibly.

### Response Time

We will do our best to respond to security vulnerability reports within **72 hours** of receipt. Our goal is to provide an initial response within this period, including a remediation plan and a timeline for the fix.

### Disclosure Process

Once a security vulnerability has been verified and resolved, we will disclose the fix and announce via:

- **Release Notes**: Security fixes will be documented in the projectâ€™s release notes.
- **Issue Tracker**: In cases where the vulnerability report was made through GitHub Issues, we will provide an update here once the issue is resolved.
- **Acknowledgments**: If you would like to be credited for discovering the vulnerability, please let us know, and we will acknowledge your contribution publicly unless you request anonymity.
